In practice, Caiman locally projects the model of the background activity to the spatial footprint of the neuron, and adds a moving percentile of this projected trace to the denominator as an additional normalizing term (see the discussion on the background model below). This acts as an empirical fudge factor that can keep $\\Delta F/F$ from getting too large for very small values of $F_0$ (especially when using denoised traces). Users may prefer to use the more traditional equation directly. Thanks to Peter Rupprecht for a helpful discussion of this topic. \n",
